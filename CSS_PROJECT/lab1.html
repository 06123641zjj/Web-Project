			      I have a thing for fried noodles. They are and always will be one of my favorite things to eat. In fact, I kinda sort of dream about going to Japan in the summertime just so I can eat yakisoba at a summer festival.
			      I mean, I have been to Japan and I have had yakisoba there, but not at a summer festival, which is supposed to be one of the ultimate Japanese experiences. Mike totally wants to go to Japan in the summer as well.

			      Guys, I have been having the BEST time camping. We have been going off the grid, sans internet and it has been wonderful. I never knew how addicted I was to my phone. Okay, who am I kidding, I definitely knew, and I needed an intervention.
			      Camping along the Pacific Northwest coast has been the sweetest intervention ever.
